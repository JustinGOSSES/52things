The phrase “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” was written by Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke in reference to building upon the work his predecessors. In science, we often think of these giants as long dead men in history books. In computer science, many of the giants are still alive. In open-source, they are people you meet at conferences. In innersource, they are your co-workers writing code right now, including those you’ve never met.
 
If there is a low hanging fruit of innovation, it might be innersource. While open-source has proved its value in terms of better code through more eyeballs and the ability of leveraging mindshare to organize development of code ecosystems without centralized control, open-source is hard for companies and especially hard for oil and gas. Lawyers get involved. Release processes are slow, non-existent, or written for the worst-case scenario. innersource offers many of the benefits with increased speed and less institutional pushback. It can also be a stepping stone to open-source.
 
innersource refers to the sharing, reuse, and distributed development of code inside an  organization. While oil and gas companies are adept at sharing within disciplines geographically distributed in multiple offices, up and down the organization hierarchy one layer at a time, or among disciplines operating in a local area, innersource needs to be code sharing across the entire company. Financial analysts and geoscientists both use Pandas, a Python library for data analysis. Petrophysicists and procurement analysts both use natural language processing to find patterns in pools of text documents too large to read. Traditional boundaries in oil and gas aren't helpful when it comes to sharing code. The distinguishing characteristics are tools and techniques, not discipline, geography, or upstream versus downstream.
 
Although inner-source can be evaluated entirely through the lens of contributions to projects additional to the work of the main project team, this would be a mistake. In a company that does inner-source well, code is more secure, because there are more eyeballs on it. Projects are written faster as more code can be reused. As the rate of code reuse and external contributions increase, code reusers have heightened expectations for good documentation and the original developers have a greater need for better test coverage resulting in more reliable code. Micro-services become increasingly preferred over monolithic architectures to take advantage of previously written code. Micro-services and APIs together can punch holes in data silos as they allow data to flow more easily across system boundaries. More value is taken from already paid for GUI-based software tools, when small scripts that can run within them are shared widely. When more people writing code can find examples of similar code being written by others, opportunities for mentorship increase, development time decreases, and sparsely distributed expert knowledge can more efficiently be distributed to where it is needed.
 
A central enterprise instance of github, gitlab, or bitbucket running behind the company firewall is the well established answer to how to begin with inner-source. To be effective though, an organization also needs to adapt company culture and communication channels. Managers need to give developers permission to contribute to projects outside their main objectives and time to manage pull requests after the main development phase is done. In a large organization, finding similar code projects and similar developers can be a challenge itself. A company-wide chat tool that enables topic-based communication, and not only person-to-person initiated communication is needed to connect people who will have never met. There may also be a need for recommendation engines that use enterprise code repositories as content to connect people and products, but there aren’t well established products for this yet.
 
There are a lot more young people who know how to program today and many mid-career people learning how to code as interest in data science increases. As more people have the skills and the amount of time needed to write code decreases, the amount of code written will increase, the location of people writing code in the organization will radically diversify, and the need for effective means to share and manage code across large organizations will become more pressing. All oil and gas companies will eventually have an inner-source program. The companies that have a better inner-source program earlier will be at an advantage. When you can stand on the shoulders of the guy in the UK office, and he can stand on your shoulders, you can progress very quickly.
